Version 3.3     2019 Dec  5

   o   Fixed: evplot.rfd(), when adding a site quantile function to an existing
       plot, would plot an incorrectly scaled version of the quantile function
       (it would plot the unscaled quantiles of the regional frequency
       distribution rather than applying the appropriate site-specific scale
       factor ("index flood")).

   o   [Invisible to users] Internal code no longer assumes that class() of a
       matrix has length 1 (would have caused error in R version 4.0.0).


Version 3.2     2019 Mar 10

   o   Fixed: in cluinf(), incorrect test of whether argument 'merge' could be
       the result of a call to cluagg().


Version 3.1     2017 Aug  1

   o   "Native routines" are now "registered".

   o   The simulation procedure used in regtst() involves fitting a kappa
       distribution to the regional data.  The kappa fit may fail, in which
       case a generalized logistic distribution is used instead.  This has
       always been the case, but is now documented.

   o   Fixed: regtst.s() would give an error for a region containing a single
       site.


Version 3.0-1   2015 Feb  1

   o   Maintainer's email address changed.  No changes to code.


Version 3.0     2014 Jan 13

   o   Increase in major version number, occasioned by some significant recent
       changes:

       *  Fix to regsimq() noted below: earlier versions of the package would
          give incorrect results, though errors were typically less than 10%.

       *  Change to computation of relative RMSE in version 2.5.

       Results returned by regsimq() in earlier versions of the package should
       be regarded as unreliable.

   o   Now explictly imports standard package "stats", and functions from
       standard package "graphics".

   o   In regfit() and regsimq(), the search path used to find the functions
       specified in the arguments regfit(dist=) and regsimq(fit=) is now
       explicitly defined.  (The search path was previously undocumented,
       and was not consistent across all prior versions of the package.)

   o   regfit() and regsimq() give more informative error messages when the
       functions specified in their respective arguments 'dist' and 'fit'
       cannot be found.

   o   regquantbounds() and sitequantbounds() should now never return negative
       error bounds.  Instead, NA or Inf is returned for error bounds
       corresponding to negative or positive estimated quantiles, respectively.

   o   regsimq() is faster, by about 25% in the author's tests.

   o   Fixed: regquantbounds() and sitequantbounds() would give negative values
       for RMSEs corresponding to negative estimated quantiles.

   o   Fixed: regsimq() computed incorrect values in its return value component
       "relbounds.by site".

   o   Fixed: sitequantbounds(), when 'sitenames' is missing and 'index' has
       names, is documented to use the names of 'index' as the site names
       but did not in fact do so.


Version 2.5     2013 Jun 17

   o   Now depends on package lmom, version >= 2.0.

   o   New function regtst.s().

   o   In regsimq(), the computation of relative RMSE of estimates of
       quantiles of the regional growth curve has been modified, and is now
       more consistent with the error bounds for different probabilities.
       The interpretation of the relative RMSE has not changed: it is still
       the relative RMSE of the estimated regional growth curve regarded as
       an estimator of a randomly chosen site growth curve.

   o   In 'regsimq(...,save=TRUE)', the matrix that is component 'sim.rgcratio'
       of the return value now has row names (derived from the value of the
       function's argument 'f').

   o   Component "D" of the return value from regtst() now has names (the site
       names).

   o   LICENSE file no longer included in package, to avoid a NOTE when
       building the package for CRAN under R version 3.0.0.  The license
       can be found at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html.


Version 2.4     2012 Jan 23

   o   The package uses lazy loading of data, so its datasets (Appalach,
       Cascades, Maxwind) can be accessed without first calling data().

   o   regtst() now responds more quickly to a user interrupt (e.g. pressing
       Esc from the R Windows GUI).

   o   Fixed: regtst() would give an error when the discordancy measure could
       not be calculated because the covariance matrix of the sample L-moment
       ratios (matrix A of Hosking and Wallis, 1997, eq. (3.2)) was singular.


Version 2.3     2010 Aug 21

   o   regsimq() no longer gives an error when asked to compute the estimation
       accuracy for an infinite quantile; instead it returns NaN values in the
       relevant places (i.e., elements corresponding to infinite quantiles in
       the "rel.RMSE" and "rel.bound..." variables of the data frames in
       components "relbounds.rgc" and "relbounds.by.site").

   o   Fixed: when a data frame with only 6 columns was supplied as argument
       'regdata' of regtst(), and summary() was called on the resulting object
       of class "regtst", an error would occur ("Error in quawak ... missing
       values in parameter vector").


Version 2.2     2009 Nov 16

   o   evplot.rfd() gains an argument 'add'.

   o   In the return values of regquantbounds() and sitequantbounds(),
       column names of "bound" items no longer contain an embedded space:
       their format is "bound.0.05" etc.

   o   The data frame supplied as argument 'regdata' of regtst() now need have
       only 6 rather than 7 columns; if it does, some output quantities will
       not be calculated.  (Originally claimed as a feature of Version 2.0,
       but not actually implemented therein.)


Version 2.1     2009 Jul 10

   o   evplot.rfd() is now exported from the package namespace.

   o   Fixed: as.regdata() would give an error when its argument 'x' was a
       data frame with default column names ("V1, "V2", etc.).


Version 2.0     2009 Apr 30

   o  This version of the package aims to enable straightforward computation
      of all the procedures in chapters 3-6 of Hosking and Wallis (1997).
      To that end there are several new functions:

      *  regavlmom() computes regional average L-moments. It is similar to
         reglmr() but its interface is more consistent with other functions
         in the package.

      *  regfit() fits a regional frequency distribution to a regional data
         set.

      *  regsimh() runs simulations to estimate the distribution of
         heterogeneity and goodness-of-fit measures.

      *  regsimq() runs simulations to estimate the variability of quantile
         estimates from a regional frequency distribution.

      *  regqfunc() and siteqfunc() return the regional growth curve and the
         quantile functions for individual sites, respectively, from a regional
         frequency distribution fitted by regfit().

      *  regquant() and sitequant() directly compute quantiles of the regional
         growth curve and of distributions for individual sites, respectively,
         from a regional frequency distribution fitted by regfit().

      *  regquantbounds() and sitequantbounds() compute error bounds for
         the regional growth curve and for quantiles at individual sites,
         respectively, from a regional frequency distribution fitted by
         regfit().

      *  print.rfd(), print.regsimh(), and print.regsimq() are print methods
         for the objects returned by regfit(), regsimh(), and regsimq(),
         respectively.

   o   Class "regdata" is introduced as a standard structure for storing
       L-moments and other key data for the sites in a region.

   o   New function as.regdata() coerces suitably structured data frames to
       class "regdata".

   o   New function evplot.rfd() is a method for generic function evplot()
       in package 'lmom'.  It facilitates graphical display of the results
       returned by regfit(), regquantbounds(), and sitequantbounds().

   o   regsamlmu(), with suitable values of its arguments, now returns
       an object of class "regdata".

   o   Argument 'regdat' of regtst() is renamed 'regdata', and is expected
       to be of class "regdata" (after coercion if necessary).

   o   reglmr() is deprecated; regavlmom() is the recommended replacement.
