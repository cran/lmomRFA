Version 2.1     2009 Jul 10

   o   evplot.rfd() is now exported from the package namespace.

   o   Fixed: as.regdata() would give an error when its argument 'x' was a
       data frame with default column names ("V1, "V2", etc.).


Version 2.0     2009 Apr 30

   o  This version of the package aims to enable straightforward computation
      of all the procedures in chapters 3-6 of Hosking and Wallis (1997).
      To that end there are several new functions:

      *  regavlmom() computes regional average L-moments. It is similar to
         reglmr() but its interface is more consistent with other functions
         in the package.

      *  regfit() fits a regional frequency distribution to a regional data
         set.

      *  regsimh() runs simulations to estimate the distribution of
         heterogeneity and goodness-of-fit measures.

      *  regsimq() runs simulations to estimate the variability of quantile
         estimates from a regional frequency distribution.

      *  regqfunc() and siteqfunc() return the regional growth curve and the
         quantile functions for individual sites, respectively, from a regional
         frequency distribution fitted by regfit().

      *  regquant() and sitequant() directly compute quantiles of the regional
         growth curve and of distributions for individual sites, respectively,
         from a regional frequency distribution fitted by regfit().

      *  regquantbounds() and sitequantbounds() compute error bounds for
         the regional growth curve and for quantiles at individual sites,
         respectively, from a regional frequency distribution fitted by
         regfit().

      *  print.rfd(), print.regsimh(), and print.regsimq() are print methods
         for the objects returned by regfit(), regsimh(), and regsimq(),
         respectively.

   o   Class "regdata" is introduced as a standard structure for storing
       L-moments and other key data for the sites in a region.

   o   New function as.regdata() coerces suitably structured data frames to
       class "regdata".

   o   New function evplot.rfd() is a method for generic function evplot()
       in package 'lmom'.  It facilitates graphical display of the results
       returned by regfit(), regquantbounds(), and sitequantbounds().

   o   regsamlmu(), with suitable values of its arguments, now returns
       an object of class "regdata".

   o   Argument 'regdat' of regtst() is renamed 'regdata', and is expected
       to be of class "regdata" (after coercion if necessary).

   o   The data frame supplied as argument 'regdata' of regtst() now need have
       only 6 rather than 7 columns; if it does, some output quantities will
       not be calculated.

   o   reglmr() is deprecated; regavlmom() is the recommended replacement.
